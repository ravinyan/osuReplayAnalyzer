## osu! Replay Analyzer

Application for analyzing replays for osu! gamemode in rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

Skin can be changed for now in scuffed way by replacing ONLY files in current skin folder, just dont change any folder name.

## Features

- Compatibility with osu! and osu!lazer
- Watching replay frame by frame
- Shows Hit markers on click
- Jumping to any point in replay
- Would write you can turn off Hidden mod... but the mod isn't even implemented (yet)... so no Hidden mod in replays
- Getting replay simply by pressing F2 on replay screen in game
- Rate change slider from 0.25x to 2x speed
- UR bar where late hits are on the left and early on the right
- Jumping to closest misses to the Left or Right of current time in replay
- Toggleable Key Overlay that shows length of clicks
- Judgemegent Timeline for x100, x50 and misses with toggles to enable/disable them separately
- osu!lazer mod compatibility with mods and their settings that change gameplay in any way, like Difficulty Adjust (excluding Strict Tracking, Random, Target Practice and Fun mods)
- And probably more SoonTM...

## Download

Go to the latest release [here](https://github.com/ravinyan/osuReplayAnalyzer/releases) and download win-x64 zip folder... sadly it's windows only (blame WPF). 

Folder can be moved freely anywhere but don't delete/move or modify files inside it since it can lead to application not working.

## Random fun fact

This application was supposed to be a simple parser for just osu! replay/beatmap files, but i was bored and curious so it evolved into this replay analyzer... oops?
