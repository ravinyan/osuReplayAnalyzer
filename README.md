## osu! Replay Analyzer

Application for analyzing your replays for osu! gamemode in rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

There are still some bugs that should be fixed soon and missing features that are in osu! like UR bar, DT/HT speed modifiers (they currently work but at 1.0x speed) but will slowly work towards adding all these features and hopefully more.

Sometimes application might crash when getting replay from osu!lazer, if that happens just exit the current map (pick a different map) and then go back to the replay screen and try again... from testing this never happened in osu! but in case this happens it should work there too... sorry.

## Features

- Compatibility with osu! and osu!lazer
- Watching replay frame by frame
- Shows Hit markers on click
- Jumping to any point in replay
- Hit judgements (in osu!lazer style with slider head/tick/tail misses and slider head judgements)
- Would write you can turn off Hidden mod... but the mod isn't even implemented (yet)... so no Hidden mod in replays
- Getting replay file simply by pressing F2 on replay screen
- And probably more SoonTM...

## Download

Go to the newest release or [here](https://github.com/ravinyan/osuReplayAnalyzer/releases/tag/V0.1.0) and download win-x64 zip folder... sadly it's windows only (blame WPF). 

Folder can be moved freely anywhere but don't delete/move or modify files inside it since it can lead to application not working.

## Random fun fact

This application was supposed to be a simple parser for just osu! replay/beatmap files, but i was bored and curious so it evolved into this replay analyzer... oops?
